# 🖼️ ROI Cropper Tool

This module provides an interactive OpenCV-based tool that allows users to manually crop a **region of interest (ROI)** centered around key features (e.g., drilled holes, defect zones) in ultra-high-resolution microscope images.

It helps magnify fine structural features—such as cracks around cooling holes—so they can be processed more effectively by machine learning models or further image analysis scripts.
